# BootstraPlus

_Bootstraplus: Born from the idea of being able to use reusable and maintainable CSS over time, allowing its use in all the desired projects. Bootstrap currently in its latest stable version (4.4) works this way._

_Bootstraplus uses the same writing syntax as the original does, but it comes with many additional features, so you can create a complete project using Bootstrap 4 and Botstraplus at the same time, with zero lines of additional CSS code._

_Additionally Bootstraplus dreams of the idea that it is completely free for the entire community of web designers and developers unlike other Frameworks such as Material Design for Bootstrap that has a paid "Pro" version._

* [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) - Node Package Manager or simply npm is a package manager, which will make our lives easier when working with Node
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/es/) - Node.js is a server-side JavaScript environment that uses an asynchronous and event driven model
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/) - Version control software designed by Linus Torvalds
* [Github](https://github.com/) - GitHub es un sistema de gesti칩n de proyectos y control de versiones de c칩digo, as칤 como una plataforma de red social dise침ada para Desarrolladores
* [Ruby](https://rubyinstaller.org/) - Ruby is a programming language created by Yukihiro Matsumoto, in this case, Ruby is required by Node.js and Sass to compile the styles to CSS
