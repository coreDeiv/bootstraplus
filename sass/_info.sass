// # BootstraPlus

// _Bootstraplus: Born from the idea of being able to use reusable and maintainable CSS over time, allowing its use in all the desired projects. Bootstrap currently in its latest stable version (4.4) works this way._

// _Bootstraplus uses the same writing syntax as the original does, but it comes with many additional features, so you can create a complete project using Bootstrap 4 and Botstraplus at the same time, with zero lines of additional CSS code._

// _Additionally Bootstraplus dreams of the idea that it is completely free for the entire community of web designers and developers unlike other Frameworks such as Material Design for Bootstrap that has a paid "Pro" version._

// ## How to add it to my project ?

// ### Web Designer and Developer.

// _Step by step installation by repository cloning, pull request, pulls and push_

// ### Web Content Manager.

// _Step by step installation by Wordpress, Prestashop, Odoo, Joomla among others and own development projects by editor_

// ## Built with:

// _Basically the entire project has been built from scratch, with some development bases of the Bootstrap and Sass environment._

// _In any case, all the tools for its development are listed:_

// * [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) - SASS is a tool for web developers of websites, which allow translating a code of non-standard style sheets (SASS or SCSS), specific to the preprocessor in question, to a standard CSS code, understandable by browsers.
// * [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) - Node Package Manager or simply npm is a package manager, which will make our lives easier when working with Node
// * [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/es/) - Node.js is a server-side JavaScript environment that uses an asynchronous and event driven model
// * [Git](https://git-scm.com/) - Version control software designed by Linus Torvalds
// * [Github](https://github.com/) - GitHub is a project management and code version control system, as well as a social network platform designed for Developers
// * [Ruby](https://rubyinstaller.org/) - Ruby is a programming language created by Yukihiro Matsumoto, in this case, Ruby is required by Node.js and Sass to compile the styles to CSS
